// Use typeof operator to find the datatype of the string in q1. 

// We've got a variable 'a' holding a string value
let a = "Millionaire";

// And 'b' holding a number
let b = 3;

// When we add a string and a number, JS turns the number into a string and sticks them together
let sum = a + b; // Result will be "Millionaire3"

// typeof() operator in JS tells us what type of data a variable has

console.log(typeof(a)); // This will print "string" because 'a' is text

// console.log() is a built-in function in JavaScript that is used to print output to the console.
