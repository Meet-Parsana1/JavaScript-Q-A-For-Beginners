// TRY TO CHANGE THE 4TH CHARACTER OF A GIVEN STRING. WHERE YOU ABLE TO DO IT ?

let undefeatable = "Meet";

undefeatable[3] = "e";

console.log(undefeatable);
//console.log() is a built-in function in JavaScript that is used to print output to the console.

// No, we are not able to change the 4th character of a given string bcoz in JS "strings" are "immutable", means we cannot change it when once defined. Also, whatever function we apply on a string, returns a new string, not change the existing one.
