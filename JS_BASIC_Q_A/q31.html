<!-- 
Notice there is no <tbody> tag in this code.

      1.View Page Source:
      When you right-click the page and choose "View Page Source," you will see the HTML you wrote—without a <tbody>.
      
      2.Browser Behavior:
      Modern browsers automatically add a <tbody> element to the DOM if you don’t include one.
      
      If you inspect the table using "Inspect Element" (Developer Tools), you will see a <tbody> wrapping your <tr> rows, even though you didn’t write it.
      But in "View Page Source," you will not see <tbody> because it shows your original code, not the browser’s parsed DOM.
