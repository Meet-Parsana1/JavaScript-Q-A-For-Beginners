// Create a const object in JS. Can you change it to hold a number later.


//---> What is an Object in JavaScript?

// An object is a collection of properties.

// A property is a key-value pair (key = name, value = data).

// In simple words: an object is like a real-world entity with characteristics (properties) and sometimes actions (methods).

// SYNTAX OF OBJECT:- 

// let objectName = {
//       key1: value1,
//       key2: value2,
//       key3: value3,
// };

//this an object of type const, meaning it cannot be reassigned
const person = {
      name: "Meet",
      age: 19,
      hobby: "Coding",
};

person = 3; //Not allowed

console.log(person); // console.log() is a built-in function in JavaScript that is used to print output to the console.

// No, we cannot change it to hold a number later as it is of const type. But we can change and add key-value pairs into an object.
